A PhD student at Khalifa University of Science and Technology (KUST) and part of Khalifa University Center for Autonomous Robotic Systems (KUCARS). My main research interests include autonomous systems development, robotic vision and navigation. I have been involved in the development of several projects in Robotics using different robotic platforms including UGVs, UAVs, and manipulator arms.

Projects Overview
======

**Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning for Model Reconstruction and Mapping**

August 2017 – Present

The project focusses on enhancing the Coverage Path Planning by dividing the effort on a team of robots instead of using one robot taking into consideration several aspects including: distance, energy, and accuracy. Model-based and non-model based approaches are being explored using a team of UAVs. 



**Coverage Path Planning for Inspecting Large Structures Using Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs)**

Jun 2015 – Dec 2016

Master's Thesis project that study the problem of large structures inspection such as aircraft, bridge and buildings. UAV platform is used in this project to follow a generated path that fully covers the 3D structure in order to gather data for performing accurate 3D reconstruction. The developed algorithm is a model based algorithm that performs coverage path planning to generate a trajectory that guarantees coverage and accuracy to certain resolution.

**Grasping Different Objects Based on a Touch Based Analysis**

Sep 2014 – Dec 2014

Independent study research titled “Grasping Different Objects Based on a Touch Based Analysis” performed using Mitsubishi manipulator arm and Barrett Robotic hand available in KURI lab

**Search, Locate and Retrieve samples from search and rescue scenarios**

Jan 2014 – Dec 2014

Senior Design Project titled “Search, Locate and Retrieve samples from search and rescue scenarios” in partnership with the Robotics Institute of Khalifa University, the focus of this project is to deliver a mobile autonomous system using Seekur Jr. Robot where a lot of robotics concepts are used including navigation, exploration, path planning, grasping, vision, image processing, and object recognition.
